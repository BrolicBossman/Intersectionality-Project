        <h2> Anti - Blackness is racism that can be disguised with subtle and passive responses that strip away a persons existence. It takes away the recognition that Black people especially have living in this world, the culture, the struggle, and the accomplishments go down the drain with anti - blackness </h2>
        <h2>In the New York Times article, Call It What It Is: Anti-Blackness its states "Anti-blackness describes the inability to recognize black humanity. It captures the reality that the kind of violence that saturates black life is not based on any specific thing a black person — better described as “a person who has been racialized black” — did. The violence we experience isn’t tied to any particular transgression. It’s gratuitous and unrelenting."</h2>
