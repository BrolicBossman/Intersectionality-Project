          <h2><center>Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw</center></h2>
          <h2>Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw is a professor at Columbia Law who focuses on race and gendered issues. She created the term intersectionality due to a legal opinion she read written by a judge about a Black Woman who's case he dismissed. With intersectionality she was able to put a word to the crossroads of the case.</h2>
          <h2>Once again in The urgency of intersectionality, Crenshaw states "Now, the experience that gave rise to intersectionality was my chance encounter with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid. Emma DeGraffenreid was an African-American woman, a working wife and a mother. I actually read about Emma's story from the pages of a legal opinion written by a judge who had dismissed Emma's claim of race and gender discrimination against a local car manufacturing plant.......Now, the judge in question dismissed Emma's suit, and the argument for dismissing the suit was that the employer did hire African-Americans and the employer hired women. The real problem, though, that the judge was not willing to acknowledge was what Emma was actually trying to say, that the African-Americans that were hired, usually for industrial jobs, maintenance jobs, were all men. And the women that were hired, usually for secretarial or front-office work, were all white. Only if the court was able to see how these policies came together would he be able to see the double discrimination that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing."</h2>
