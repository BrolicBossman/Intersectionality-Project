        <h2> Being apart of a Marginalized Group tends to have you excluded and facing discrimination all because of your identity and social expression. Your race, gender, age, disability, sexual preference and even immigration status are marginalized groups that face inequality. </h2>
        <h2>In Social Media + Society, Power Dynamics it states "Power dynamics are inherent in all forms of communication but are especially relevant to marginalized identity invocation. By definition, marginalized groups are those that have been historically disenfranchised and therefore experience systemic inequality; that is, they have operated with less power than have systemically privileged groups (Hall, 1989; A. G. Johnson, 2018; Williams, 1998). These power dynamics are both contextual and relational; people are born into some forms of privilege while other forms are earned, and a marginalized status exists in tension with a privileged status (and vice versa)."</h2>
